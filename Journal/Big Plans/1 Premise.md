Game that focuses on movement and combat mechanics with a strange item-based/class-based progression system that feels semi-random.

Game that uses randomized room layouts to throw players off and make for unique playthroughs

Permadeath - Challenge Based (Can you reach the bottom floor and win?)

Wild difficulty curves - feeling that its nearly impossible

Targeted towards nerds like me

1 hour timers on each floor for intense progression - time paused only on pause menu
